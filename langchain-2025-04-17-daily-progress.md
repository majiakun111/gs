We only need to rebuild model schemas if type annotation information
isn't available during declaration - that shouldn't be the case for
these types corrected here.

Need to do more thorough testing to make sure these structures have
complete schemas, but hopefully this boosts startup / import time. by Sydney Runkle
- Galaxia integration (#30792)

- [ ] **PR title**: "docs: adding Smabbler's Galaxia integration"

- [ ] **PR message**:  **Twitter handle:** @Galaxia_graph

I'm adding docs here + added the package to the packages.yml. I didn't
add a unit test, because this integration is just a thin wrapper on top
of our API. There isn't much left to test if you mock it away.

- langchain: infer Perplexity provider for sonar model prefix (#30861)

**Description:** This PR adds provider inference logic to
`init_chat_model` for Perplexity models that use the "sonar..." prefix
(`sonar`, `sonar-pro`, `sonar-reasoning`, `sonar-reasoning-pro` or
`sonar-deep-research`).

This allows users to initialize these models by simply passing the model
name, without needing to explicitly set `model_provider="perplexity"`.

The docstring for `init_chat_model` has also been updated to reflect
this new inference rule. by milosz-l

https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/30778 (not released)

`"message"` from `generation_info`, but we turned `generation_info` into

We have a `list.py` file which causes a namespace conflict with `list`

`__all__` is already a list, so no need to coerce. by Sydney Runkle
- core: Remove some noqa (#30855) by Christophe Bornet
- standard-tests: release 0.3.18 (#30854) by ccurme
- infra: run old standard-tests on core releases (#30852)

On core releases, we check out the latest published package for
langchain-openai and langchain-anthropic and run their tests against the
candidate version of langchain-core.

Because these packages have a local install of langchain-tests, we also
need to check out the previous version of langchain-tests. by ccurme
- core[fix]: remove `load` from dynamic imports dict (#30849) by Sydney Runkle
- core: release 0.3.52 (#30850) by ccurme
- Fix `from langchain_core.load.load import load` import (#30843)

TL;DR: you can't optimize imports with a lazy `__getattr__` if there is
a namespace conflict with a module name and an attribute name. We should
avoid introducing conflicts like this in the future.

This PR fixes a bug introduced by my lazy imports PR:
https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/30769.

In `langchain_core`, we have utilities for loading and dumping data.
Unfortunately, one of those utilities is a `load` function, located in
`langchain_core/load/load.py`. To make this function more visible, we
make it accessible at the top level `langchain_core.load` module via
importing the function in `langchain_core/load/__init__.py`.

So, either of these imports should work:

```py
from langchain_core.load import load
from langchain_core.load.load import load
```

As you can tell, this is already a bit confusing. You'd think that the
first import would produce the module `load`, but because of the
`__init__.py` shortcut, both produce the function `load`.

<details> More on why the lazy imports PR broke this support...

All was well, except when the absolute import was run first, see the
last snippet:

```
>>> from langchain_core.load import load
>>> load
<function load at 0x101c320c0>
```

```
>>> from langchain_core.load.load import load
>>> load
<function load at 0x1069360c0>
```

```
>>> from langchain_core.load import load
>>> load
<function load at 0x10692e0c0>
>>> from langchain_core.load.load import load
>>> load
<function load at 0x10692e0c0>
```

```
>>> from langchain_core.load.load import load
>>> load
<function load at 0x101e2e0c0>
>>> from langchain_core.load import load
>>> load
<module 'langchain_core.load.load' from '/Users/sydney_runkle/oss/langchain/libs/core/langchain_core/load/load.py'>
```

In this case, the function `load` wasn't stored in the globals cache for
the `langchain_core.load` module (by the lazy import logic), so Python
defers to a module import.

New `langchain` tongue twister ðŸ˜œ: we've created a problem for ourselves
because you have to load the load function from the load file in the
load module ðŸ˜¨. by Sydney Runkle
- core[patch]: dict chat prompt template support (#25674)

- Support passing dicts as templates to chat prompt template
- Support making *any* attribute on a message a runtime variable
- Significantly simpler than trying to update our existing prompt
template classes

```python
    template = ChatPromptTemplate(
        [
            {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "text",
                        "text": "{text1}",
                        "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"},
                    },
                    {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"path": "{local_image_path}"}},
                ],
                "name": "{name1}",
                "tool_calls": [
                    {
                        "name": "{tool_name1}",
                        "args": {"arg1": "{tool_arg1}"},
                        "id": "1",
                        "type": "tool_call",
                    }
                ],
            },
            {
                "role": "tool",
                "content": "{tool_content2}",
                "tool_call_id": "1",
                "name": "{tool_name1}",
            },
        ]
    )

```

will likely close #25514 if we like this idea and update to use this
logic
